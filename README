# MatchMyResume

MatchMyResume is a web application designed to help users match their resumes to job descriptions effectively. This project consists of two main components: the frontend and the backend.

## Backend

The backend handles the processing of resumes and job descriptions, performs matching algorithms, and serves the results to the frontend.
### Technologies Used
- FastAPI (Python framework for building APIs)
- Python (for advanced text processing)

### Features
- Parse and analyze resume and job description content.
- Implement matching algorithms to calculate compatibility scores.
- Provide RESTful APIs for frontend integration.

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment using `python`:
    ```bash
    python -m venv matchmyresume-env
    source matchmyresume-env/bin/activate 
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. export your openAI_API_KEY:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY = replace_with_your_openai_api_key
    ```
5.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
6. The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.


## Frontend

The frontend is responsible for providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to upload their resumes and job descriptions, and view the matching results.

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- MUI

### Features
- Upload resume and job description files.
- Display matching results in a visually appealing format.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. change the BASE_URL in ./src/App.jsx
    ```bash
    const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000";
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`.
